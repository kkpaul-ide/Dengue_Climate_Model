# The implications of climate change on dengue virus transmission in Bangladesh

This repository contains all the code

# DOI

All codes were created and run using R statistical software version 4.2.2 and Rstudio version 2022.02.3+492 "Prairie Trillium" Release with associated packages (tidyverse 1.3.2; tidymodels 1.0.0; reshape2 1.4.4; minpack.lm 1.2-3; readr 2.1.4; lubridate 1.9.2; R.utils 2.12.2; cowplot 1.1.1). Some of the data files required to run the scrits are not publicly available and have been excluded from the repository (but can be provided on request). Please report an issue if you have any problems running the code or contact either Kpaul@kirby.unsw.edu.au or Rgray@kirby.unsw.edu.au.

# Aims

1. To develop and validate a mechanistic model of dengue transmission that can make long-term projections of dengue incidence and sero-prevalence over time in endemic regions, under different climate change scenarios.

2. To utilize the mechanistic model and project the changes in magnitude and seasonality of dengue outbreaks in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, throughout the 21st Century, under different climate change scenarios.


# Contributors
The main developers for the project code are Dr Kishor K. Paul and Dr Richard T. Gray who are in the Surveillance and Evaluation Research Program (SERP) at the The Kirby Institute, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia. Kishor Paul was the primarily developer of the model, data analysis and calculation scripts under the supervision of Dr Gray. Both maintain the repository.
