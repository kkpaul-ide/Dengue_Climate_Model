# Title

This repository contains all the code

# DOI

All codes were created and run using R statistical software version 4.0.2 and Rstudio version 1.3.1056 with associated packages (ncdf4 1.17; tidyverse 1.3.0; reshape2 1.4.4; raster 3.3-7; RColorBrewer 1.1-2; grid 4.0.2; rgdal 1.5-12; cowplot 1.1.1). Some of the data files required to run the scripts are not publicly available and have been excluded from the repository (but can be provided on request). Please report an issue if you have any problems running the code or contact either Kpaul@kirby.unsw.edu.au or Rgray@kirby.unsw.edu.au.
